# Hello!

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Ye Danqi. I am a PhD Candidate at the National University of Singapore. My research
interest intersects machine learning and neuroscience, and I investigate different models of intelligence
such as Learning in Spiking Neural Networks, Catastrophic Forgetting, and Semantic Representation. I am
supervised by Professor Chen Tsuhan. Have a look at my research notes to find out what I am up to! Lastly,
this site is still under heavy construction as I try to figure out how to use Github pages, so be sure to hop
back for more after a few months if you don't find what you are looking for today!
